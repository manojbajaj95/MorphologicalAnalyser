# MorphologicalAnalyser
This is morphological analyser created for the purpose of HUL242 assignment.

I have implemented a stemmer which removes the common suffixes as well as the prefixes. The code uses enchant library for dictionary resources dependency. I have also used NLTK inbuilt stemmers i.e. Porter, Lancaster, Snowball Stemmer and word net lemmatizer to check how close the results are. 

To use the program:
You need:
1. Python 3+
2. Enchant library
3. NLTK
4. Snowball Stemmer
5. Word Net
Option 3-5 are optional as they just compare the results with my stemmer.
